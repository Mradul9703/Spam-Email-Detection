# Spam Mail Detection using Logistic Regression

A machine learning project that detects whether an email is **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using **Logistic Regression**. The system processes raw email text, extracts features using TF-IDF vectorization, and classifies the input using a trained ML model.

## Project Motivation

Spam emails can clutter inboxes, waste time, and often pose security threats. Detecting them automatically using machine learning enhances email filtering systems and user safety. This project demonstrates how a relatively simple logistic regression model, combined with text vectorization, can effectively classify emails with high accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` for basic visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for ML model, preprocessing, and evaluation
  - `TfidfVectorizer` for feature extraction from text

## Dataset

The dataset consists of emails labeled as `spam` or `ham` with associated metadata.
